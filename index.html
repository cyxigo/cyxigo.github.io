        <h1>About me</h1>

        I'm cyxigo, that's, of course, not my real name.
        <br />
        I'm a programmer as you can see.
        <br />
        I program in whatever I like in the moment, and now it's Go.
        <br />
        I program a lot of different stuff (though, a lot of it is private
        repos), such as programming languages, bots and games.
