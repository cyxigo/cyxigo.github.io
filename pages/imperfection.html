                <h2>Now or Never</h2>
                First track in my new album: Imperfection. I will make whatever
                I feel like, I will try my best to become better in making
                music, maybe it will be not perfect but I want to do it. This
                track means a lot to me, I didn't want to make rock or something
                heavy, I wanted to make something peaceful, hopeful, I wanted to
                capture my feelings for better tomorrow, better future. I hope
                you will like it! Tell me if I could improve something.
                <i>And it begins right there, Now or Never...</i>

                <h2>Skyline</h2>
                My first attempt at making techno music with synths and stuff. I
                was really inspired by Every End and Stereo Madness and came up
                with this short piece... Tried mixing some synths and electric
                guitar, well, tell me what you think! Oh and about the title - I
                was listening to the track when I finished it and came up with
                title. First idea was "Dawn" or "Sunset" but that's boring
                right? So, "Skyline"!
                <i>Second entry in Imperfection, woohoo!!</i>

                <h2>Unreachable Midnight</h2>
                Hey everyone! I tried myself in techno again! I really like this
                track, I think it's probably one of my most well-made tracks
                actually. Main motif of this track is from my really old work,
                and you can actually hear it in Defender, but here, I wanted to
                give it more attention. Tell me what you think about my techno
                tracks! Hope you like it :D
                <br />
                Oh wait! This is my 10th track!! woohoo!!!

                <h2>Midnight</h2>
                I really wanted to make an Unreachable Midnight sequel, so I
                came up with this short track, and I'm completely satisfied now.
                This track too, uses an old motif from my really old .flp (even
                older than Unreachable Midnight motif!) and motif that you might
                recognize from start if you listened to my first works ;) (don't
                want to spoil where it's from, kinda ruines the whole thing)
                What can I say about track overall: it's calmer than Unreachable
                Midnight, uses same bpm (180) and same synths. I only added GMS
                Agressive TE & GMS Lead Classic Vibrato as bass, Sytrus Distant
                and some closed HiHats from Drumaxx Electro 4 MC because why
                not, sounds better really. Tell me what you think about this
                track! Making techno tracks is really fun...
