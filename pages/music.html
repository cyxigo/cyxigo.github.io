                <h2>A Battle Full of Hopes</h2>
                My first ever upload of music. Though, I don't really like this
                <br />
                one that much, I just sent a friend a bunch of my old tracks (my
                <br />
                first works, some of them will be uploaded after this) and asked
                <br />
                him "what do you think I should upload from these?", he picked
                <br />
                this one. I wanted to upload all of my music made for game that
                <br />
                I will (probably) never make due to my lack of skills in <br />
                drawing, so, here it is. Tell me what do you think about it,
                <br />
                hope you will like it!

                <h2>A Battle Full of Pride</h2>
                My second upload. "Enhancing" it was making it almost entirely
                <br />
                from scratch, old version is really really different from this
                <br />
                one, but I promise, the new one is millions times better than
                <br />
                the old one. Can't say much about this track, when I was first
                <br />
                started creating it I was experimenting and didn't think I'll
                <br />
                finish or upload it anytime in future. Hope you like it! Tell me
                <br />
                what do you think about it.

                <h2>Lost</h2>
                I really liked it when I finished it first, then I made tons of
                <br />
                versions, like, absurdly many. Not talking about that main motif
                <br />
                of this song was taken from my really old project that I <br />
                somewhat forgot even existed. Now I still do like it, probably
                <br />
                my best work out of first works. Tell me what do you think about
                <br />
                it!

                <h2>A Battle Full of Wrath</h2>
                This sounded way more listenable and better way back then. I
                <br />
                don't really like it that much.. But it first track of my little
                <br />
                trilogy, so I needed to upload it. Next track in trilogy is The
                <br />
                Heavens Fall

                <h2>The Heavens Fall</h2>
                Enhancing this one was not a lot of work actually, just tried my
                <br />
                best to make it actually listenable. This project is my first
                <br />
                time using Slayer2 plugin for guitar instead of guitar soundfont
                <br />
                (you can hear this soundfont clearly in most of my first works).
                <br />
                Note: this a second track in my little trilogy, first one was A
                <br />

                <h2>Defender</h2>
                I really liked this track when I finished it (I mean last <br />
                version, this one had tons of versions before actually), that's
                <br />
                why I didn't "enhance" anything. I just exported it as it was,
                <br />
                no changes whatsoever. This project is my second time using
                <br />
                Slayer2 plugin for guitar and first time trying to make somewhat
                <br />
                melodic music. Hope you will like it! Tell me what I should
                <br />
                improve ;) Fun fact: I've changed title of this track a lot too,
                <br />
                "Defender" is a reference to song that inspired me to make this
                <br />
                Last track of my little trilogy, first one was A Battle Full of
                <br />
                Wrath and second one was The Heavens Fall
                <br />

                <h2>Catharsis</h2>
                I love this track and its main melody, beginning is kind of
                <br />
                lazy, I tried to improve it several times but in the end I just
                <br />
                returned to first version of it. Most of time spent on this
                <br />
                project was on main melody, I listened to it over and over
                <br />
                trying to improve it as much as I can :x Also tried my best to
                <br />
                make Slayer2 sound good, don't know if it sounds mainstream or
                <br />
                modern or stuff but I like it, tell me if you like it or not and
                <br />
                what to improve
