            I wanted to upload my music for a long time, these tracks were made
            for my game "The Calamity", but due to my lack of drawing skills,
            the game will (probably) never be released. Hope you will like it!

                <h2>A Battle Full of Hopes</h2>
                My first ever upload of music. Though, I don't really like this
                one that much, I just sent a friend a bunch of my old tracks (my
                first works, some of them will be uploaded after this) and asked
                him "what do you think I should upload from these?", he picked
                this one. I wanted to upload all of my music made for game that
                I will (probably) never make due to my lack of skills in
                drawing, so, here it is. Tell me what do you think about it,
                hope you will like it!

                <h2>A Battle Full of Pride</h2>
                My second upload. "Enhancing" it was making it almost entirely
                from scratch, old version is really really different from this
                one, but I promise, the new one is millions times better than
                the old one. Can't say much about this track, when I was first
                started creating it I was experimenting and didn't think I'll
                finish or upload it anytime in future. Hope you like it! Tell me
                what do you think about it.

                <h2>Lost</h2>
                I really liked it when I finished it first, then I made tons of
                versions, like, absurdly many. Not talking about that main motif
                of this song was taken from my really old project that I
                somewhat forgot even existed. Now I still do like it, probably
                my best work out of first works. Tell me what do you think about
                it! This is a sequel to A Battle Full of Pride

                <h2>A Battle Full of Wrath</h2>
                This sounded way more listenable and better way back then. I
                don't really like it that much.. But it first track of my little
                trilogy, so I needed to upload it. Next track in trilogy is The
                Heavens Fall.

                <h2>The Heavens Fall</h2>
                Enhancing this one was not a lot of work actually, just tried my
                best to make it actually listenable. This project is my first
                time using Slayer2 plugin for guitar instead of guitar soundfont
                (you can hear this soundfont clearly in most of my first works).
                <br />
                Note: this a second track in my little trilogy, first one was A
                Battle Full of Wrath.

                <h2>Defender</h2>
                I really liked this track when I finished it (I mean last <br />
                version, this one had tons of versions before actually), that's
                why I didn't "enhance" anything. I just exported it as it was,
                no changes whatsoever. This project is my second time using
                Slayer2 plugin for guitar and first time trying to make somewhat
                melodic music. Hope you will like it! Tell me what I should
                improve ;)
                <br />
                Fun fact: I've changed title of this track a lot too, "Defender"
                is a reference to song that inspired me to make this last track
                of my little trilogy, first one was A Battle Full of Wrath and
                second one was The Heavens Fall.
