                <h2>Catharsis</h2>
                I love this track and its main melody, beginning is kind of
                lazy, I tried to improve it several times but in the end I just
                returned to first version of it. Most of time spent on this
                project was on main melody, I listened to it over and over
                trying to improve it as much as I can :x Also tried my best to
                make Slayer2 sound good, don't know if it sounds mainstream or
                modern or stuff but I like it, tell me if you like it or not and
                what to improve
