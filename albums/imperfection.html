                <h2>Now or Never</h2>
                First track in my new album: Imperfection. I will make whatever
                I feel like, I will try my best to become better in making
                music, maybe it will be not perfect but I want to do it. This
                track means a lot to me, I didn't want to make rock or something
                heavy, I wanted to make something peaceful, hopeful, I wanted to
                capture my feelings for better tomorrow, better future. I hope
                you will like it! Tell me if I could improve something.
                <i>And it begins right there, Now or Never...</i>

                <h2>Skyline</h2>
                My first attempt at making techno music with synths and stuff. I
                was really inspired by Every End and Stereo Madness and came up
                with this short piece... Tried mixing some synths and electric
                guitar, well, tell me what you think! Oh and about the title - I
                was listening to the track when I finished it and came up with
                title. First idea was "Dawn" or "Sunset" but that's boring
                right? So, "Skyline"!
                <i>Second entry in Imperfection, woohoo!!</i>

                <h2>Unreachable Midnight</h2>
                Hey everyone! I tried myself in techno again! I really like this
                track, I think it's probably one of my most well-made tracks
                actually. Main motif of this track is from my really old work,
                and you can actually hear it in Defender, but here, I wanted to
                give it more attention.
                <br />
                Tell me what you think about my techno tracks! Hope you like it.
                <br />
                Oh wait! This is my 10th track!! woohoo!!!

                <h2>Midnight</h2>
                I really wanted to make an Unreachable Midnight sequel, so I
                came up with this short track, and I'm completely satisfied now.
                This track too, uses an old motif from my really old .flp (even
                older than Unreachable Midnight motif!) and motif that you might
                recognize from start if you listened to my first works ;) (don't
                want to spoil where it's from, kinda ruines the whole thing)
                <br />
                What can I say about track overall: it's calmer than Unreachable
                Midnight, uses same bpm (180) and same synths.
                <br />
                I only added GMS Agressive TE & GMS Lead Classic Vibrato as
                bass, Sytrus Distant and some closed HiHats from Drumaxx Electro
                4 MC because why not, sounds better really. Tell me what you
                think about this track! Making techno tracks is really fun...

                <h2>Imperfection</h2>
                I was going through a lot recently, so I made this orchestral
                track. Why is it called "Imperfection"? Well, it's kind of
                personal thing to me. Music has always been close to me, it
                helped me whenever I was sad and when I was happy, it made me
                even happier. I thought I could never make any piece of music,
                and when I tried, I've always found it terrible, bad, imperfect.
                But one day I decided to upload at least something ("A Battle
                Full of Hopes"). And even if no one was listening to it, I would
                be proud of it. After finishing "First Works" I decided to
                master my music making skills, to make an album that would
                reflect my emotions through the journey of learning how to make
                decent music - "Imperfection", in honor of my former fear of
                showing my music.
                <br />
                P.S: Don't worry, this isn't last track in this album ;)

                <h2>Forsaken Stars</h2>
                This is second version of "Forsaken Stars", I've unpublished
                original version. Why? I just didn't like it. Really didn't. So
                I remade it! I tried to mix synths and piano with Amen Breaks,
                made bass WAY better, and added guitar solo in the end! Also,
                BPM changed from 180 to 175, just to match Amen Breaks BPM. This
                is my biggest project to date, and the one I’ve invested the
                most time in. I hope you enjoy this track, I put everything into
                it. Tell me what you think too. Enjoy! ;)

                <h2>Lost - Redux</h2>
                When I first thought about creating the album "Imperfection",
                the first question that came to mind was "What tracks will I
                make?", and I decided that no matter what, I had to make a
                sequel to something XD
                <br />
                There’s no particular reason for it; I just thought it’d be cool
                to see the difference between "me" when I was just starting and
                "me" after finishing 4 or 5 tracks. So, here is the "Lost"
                remake/sequel! Hope you enjoy it ;)

                <h2>Creatures</h2>
                I don't really know what to say about this track. I didn't spend
                a long time on it; I came up with the concept while I was very,
                very sleepy, then returned to it later to finish it up. It's
                much slower than most of my tracks (even "Imperfection" is
                faster at 144 BPM) and very calm. Hope you enjoy it! ;)
